# Setup

For the relative imports to work, this root directory needs to be added to your PYTHONPATH

## NOTES
* `mission.py` ignores the `analysed` folder, and folders starting with `__`
* `lens_correction.py` looks in the `lens_calibration_files` subfolder for files that look like `LensParameters_<name>.npz`
